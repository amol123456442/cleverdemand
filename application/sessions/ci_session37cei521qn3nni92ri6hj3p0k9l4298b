<p align="justify">As AI assistants start to replace traditional search engines as the primary way people discover and evaluate services, GEO has emerged as a mission-critical strategy. It ensures that a brand&rsquo;s insights and authority are embedded in the answers delivered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.martechcube.com/treasure-data-debuts-ai-tools-to-revolutionize-customer-experience/">AI tools</a>&nbsp;&ndash; positioning businesses at the point of decision-making, not just after the fact.</p>
<p align="justify">Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) helps businesses become part of the answers AI platforms generate, by embedding their expertise directly in real-time, conversational responses.</p>
<p align="justify">When a user asks an AI assistant, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the top cosmetic surgeon near me?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What wealth management firm should I trust with my portfolio?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Which estate planning attorney is most experienced in my area?&rdquo;, GEO helps to determine which businesses are cited in the answer. These moments often shape high-value decisions, before a search engine is ever consulted. For example, a law firm that appears in ChatGPT&rsquo;s response to &ldquo;best estate attorney in Miami&rdquo; could earn immediate trust and consideration well before a potential client sees competing websites.</p>
<p align="justify">AI-driven discovery is accelerating. A recent Elon University study found that 52% of U.S. adults already use AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and Copilot. ChatGPT alone now serves 400 million weekly active users globally, including nearly 68 million in the U.S. With platforms like Perplexity gaining traction, AI assistants are becoming the default source for trusted, real-time answers. According to McKinsey, generative AI could add as much as $4.4 trillion in annual economic value, with marketing and sales among the most directly impacted sectors.</p>";}
