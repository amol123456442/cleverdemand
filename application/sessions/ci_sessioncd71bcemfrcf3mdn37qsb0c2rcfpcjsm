This innovative solution transforms how threat intelligence (TI) teams define, operationalize, and measure Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) across cyber, physical, and geopolitical domains, enabling faster and more effective decision-making.  Quick Intel Silobreaker launches Requirements to streamline PIR management for TI teams. Combines best-practice PIR library with monitoring tools and metrics. Covers cyber, physical, and geopolitical threat intelligence use cases. Automates asset monitoring, reducing setup time and ensuring relevance. Flexible for all team maturity levels with customizable PIR workflows. Enhances visibility and ROI through real-time dashboards and analytics. Revolutionizing PIR Management Silobreaker’s Requirements platform addresses the complexity of managing PIRs across multiple threat domains. By integrating a curated PIR library with pre-built dashboards and data sources, teams can instantly deploy operational monitoring. The platform automates the ingestion of organizational exposure data, such as tech stacks and suppliers, matching them against emerging threats for immediate coverage. “Our customers’ intelligence requirements span cyber, physical and geopolitical threats, often all at once,” said Geoffrey Brown, CEO of Silobreaker. “The launch of this innovative solution gives them a single place to define and align on those priorities; connect them across domains and deliver the intelligence their stakeholders need.”  From Ideas to Action in Clicks Implementing PIRs is often a time-intensive process, with stakeholder alignment taking months. Silobreaker’s ready-to-use PIR library, based on industry best practices, accelerates this by enabling teams to move from planning to operational monitoring in just a few clicks. This eliminates manual setup barriers, ensuring intelligence is relevant and actionable from day one.  Flexible and Scalable for All Teams The platform supports teams at every maturity level. Beginners benefit from a foundational PIR library, while advanced teams can import and adapt existing PIRs to match their unique processes. “Silobreaker supports teams at every stage of maturity and resourcing,” ensuring flexibility without rigid vendor constraints.  Measuring and Demonstrating Value Requirements integrates PIRs with real-time threat monitoring dashboards, AI-supported reporting, and built-in metrics to track outputs and demonstrate ROI. This centralized approach replaces disconnected spreadsheets, making PIRs a dynamic part of the intelligence cycle. The platform also seamlessly integrates with existing tools like TIPs and case management systems, enhancing operational efficiency.  Addressing Multi-Domain Threats As intelligence teams are increasingly tasked with covering cyber, physical, and geopolitical risks, Silobreaker’s unified platform simplifies the process. By providing comprehensive visibility and automated workflows, it empowers teams to deliver high-quality intelligence that supports stakeholder decision-making and justifies resource allocation.  About Silobreaker Silobreaker is a leading security and threat intelligence technology company that provides powerful insights on emerging risks and opportunities in near-real time. It automates the collection, aggregation and analysis of data from open and dark web sources in a single platform, allowing intelligence teams to produce and disseminate high-quality, actionable reports in line with priority intelligence requirements (PIRs).
